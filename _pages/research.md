## What is Fine-grained Analysis?
Fine-grained categorization refers to the problem of distinguishing between closely related entities, e.g., Monarch butterfly vs. Viceroy butterfly based on visual features, or Louisiana Waterthrush vs. Swainson’s Warbler based on auditory features. Analogous problems exist within medical data, language sentiment analysis, and remote sensing. Making progress in fine-grained categorization requires a combination of advanced ML research and coordination with – and respect for – human communities of knowledge.

Based on mathematical and statistical modeling of visual representations and on large scale experimental work our collaboratory strives to make foundational contributions to basic research areas such as:

Explainability -- How can AI assist human decision making in fine-grained medical domains? Can we construct AI systems for fine-grained classification that are causally explainable and interpretable by humans?

Self-supervised learning -- Push the limits of fine-grained classification by self-supervised learning. Based on expert knowledge we will exploit self-supervised learning techniques to establish representations for fine-grained few shot generalization.

Novelty detection -- Develop scalable novelty detection that is robust against extreme class imbalance and other effects of long-tailed distributions in real-world fine-grained classification problems.
