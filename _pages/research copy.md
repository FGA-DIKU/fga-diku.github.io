# Projects #

Here we showcase some of the projects we are currently involved with. 

### PHAIR ### 

The goal of the research project [PHAIR](https://di.ku.dk/english/news/2022/faster-knowledge-of-side-effects-via-artificial-intelligence/) -- Pharmacovigilance by AI Real-time Analyzes -- is to ensure faster and better knowledge about side effects and thereby increase the safety of medicinal products. 
The project will make it possible to pick up unwanted effects of medicines faster and thereby increase the quality of treatment with medicines. 
This will be done by combining national health data and using artificial intelligence in the form of algorithms and pattern recognition.

### The Stroke Research Project ###
[The Stroke project](https://www.aicentre.dk/news/research-project-will-improve-diagnostics-and-treatment-of-strokes-with-artificial-intelligence) aims to improve stroke care with artificial intelligence and will deliver the world’s first solution to significantly improve MRI-based stroke treatment and clinical workflow efficiency.
Thus, the Stroke project intends to demonstrate the effectiveness of AI solutions in the real world to improve patient access and treatment together with optimizing efficiency in the clinical work process.

Worldwide around 5.5 million people die from stroke each year and approximately 50% of the survivors are left chronically disabled. 
Fast and accurate diagnosis of suspected stroke is critical for lowering risk of death, and life-changing disabilities.

A key product of the Stroke project is the world’s first, MR-based 24/7, in-process clinical diagnostics solution for patients suspected of acute stroke. Performing MRI image analysis in-process, while the patient is still in the scanner, enables real-time decision making to optimize workflow efficiency, patient throughput and quality of care.

If successful, this project will provide a superior door-to-needle time than current MRI workflows for hyper acute patients, thereby improving patient selection for treatment and reducing recovery time for acute stroke patients.
