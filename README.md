# https://fga-diku.github.io/
This is the lab website currently. It is heavily inspired by [Allan lab](https://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html) and built on a clone of [Belongie Lab](https://www.belongielab.org/). Check them out for inspiration if you would like to change/add something to this website.

## Structure of the repo/website
* `_data`; Here you choose what information is displayed on the website through .yml files. This is mainly information about our team members and what projects to display.
* `_includes` and `_pages`; More technical setups of header/footer and layouts.
* `_pages`; Here you find markdown files that contain the main contents of the website. This should be the first place to go If you want to change the structure/text of a page. Don't change `_pages/publications` unless you have already read about the `scrape_google_scholar.py` script.
* `_plugins`; I have not touched this.
* `_sass`; This is where the bootstrap code is found. If you want to change colors or css components this is where you should look first. Start in `_variables.scss`. (Changing the colors is a bit of a mess).
* `_site`; Don't touch this one. The files here are generated by Jekyll based on the other files in this repo.
* `css` and `fonts`; Technical configuration. I have not touched this.
* `images`; Contains the images displayed on the website... pretty self explanatory.
* `js`; Javascript code for bootstrap? I have note touched this.
* `_config.yml`; Global site configurations that are rarely changed.
* `Gemfile`; Ruby dependencies. (Some of them are perhaps not used anymore after adapting from Belongie Lab website.)
* `run.sh`; Can be used to run the website on `localhost:4000`.
* `scrape_google_scholar.py` and `conda_requirements_for_scraping.yml`; A python script for scraping Mads Nielsens google scholar and updating the publications page (`_pages/publications`). It filters off some publications made by a CBS professor also called Mads Nielsen. `conda_requirements_for_scraping.yml` are the dependencies needed in order to run the python script.

## How to maintain the website
* **News**. The news on the home page is changed through `_data/news.yml`. Have a look at the file and then it should be self explanatory.
* **Team Members**. Changed through the relevant .yml file in `_data`. The images of team members should be placed in `images/projpic`. Note that the phd members are sorted alphabetically before being displayed.
* **Publications**. To update the publications to be up to date with Mads Nielsens google scholar simply run `python scrape_google_scholar.py` in a conda environment with the relevant dependencies. For other changes you either have to change this script find a new way to maintain/display publications.
* **Projects**. To add and select projects to display go to the `_data/projects.yml`. The yaml attributes should be pretty self explanatory except for perhaps the highlight attribute which can be used to toggle whether to display a project. Hence, no need to delete existing projects, instead set `highlight: 0`. The images of the projects should be placed in `images/projpic`.
* **The slider/carousel on the home page**. This is done very manually in the `_pages/home.md`file. The html for the slider is found directly within the file and some of it could for instance look like the code seen below. To add an image just make a new `<div class="item"> <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/slider7001400/name_of_image.png" alt="Slide 3" /> </div>`. You also have to change some of the other HTML code (i.e. set the number of carousel-indicators) but this should be pretty straight forward.
```
<div class="carousel-inner" markdown="0">
        <div class="item active">
            <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/slider7001400/augmentations.png" alt="Slide 1" />
        </div>
        <div class="item">
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00640v2" target="_blank">
              <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/slider7001400/pretraining.png" alt="Slide 2" />
            </a>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
            <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/slider7001400/segmentations.png" alt="Slide 3" />
        </div>
</div>
```
* **Change something not mentioned in this list**. Of course this is impossible to answer but a good tip if you for instance want to change a size/color of something is to go to the website right-click whatever you want to change and press inspect. From here you will (in most browsers) be able to change colors and set CSS attributes to see how it looks and if this is actually the change you are looking to implement.


## TO-DO:
* Finish the research page (`_pages/research`).
* Make final decision of name. Currently FiGra but if this is decided then the name of this repo should be updated along with the link above and name in `conda_requirements_for_scraping.yml`.
